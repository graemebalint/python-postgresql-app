# python-postgresql-app
A proof of concept program that connects to a postgresql database. The user can create, read, update and delete data in the database through the GUI.

Live demo: https://replit.com/@GraemeBalint/python-postgresql-app
Link to db: https://bit.io/graemebalint/python-postgresql-app

Project goals:
1. Learn how to integrate Postgresql with Python
2. Use Python to write directly to a database

Skills:
1. Databases
2. Python
3. Postgresql
4. Combining Python and Postgresql together

Project notes:
1. The GUI was built using the Tkinter module in Python. It looks better when rendered locally using a Python compiler like PyCharm. At this point, I have decided to not rebuild the GUI for a web app since the focus of this project is working with databases, Python and Postgresql.
